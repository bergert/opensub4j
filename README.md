# Java library for opensubtitles.org

OpenSub4j is an open source Java library for opensubtites. It provides an object-oriented abstraction over XML-RPC opensubtitles.org API.

This project is a fork of <https://github.com/wtekiela/opensub4j>
in order to be used by a small java program which I am maintaining.

Note: Java JDK 8 is required.
